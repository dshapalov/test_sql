//Write a program that prompts the user to enter a three-digit
//integer and determines whether it is a palindrome number. 
//A number is palindrome if it reads the same from right to left 
//and from left to right. Here is a sample run of this program:


public class Palindrome {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub

		
		
		//Test 2
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
	}

}
